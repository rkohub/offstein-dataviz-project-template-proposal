# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The Data I propose to visualize is the food nutrient dataset from the FDC

- Here is a link to the data
  - https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets

- I had to purge many of the foods to fit the size
  requirements of vizhub, I might try and refactor the data, to only contain key nutrients to add all the food samples back in

- This contains a food and then a list of its nutrients, The
  name, and how much, in statistics, like median, max, min

## Attributes

- For each food there is a big list of nutrients and their quantities. The main ones Ill be looking at are
 "Carbohydrate, by difference", "Protein", "Total lipid (fat)", "Water", "Calcium, Ca", "Potassium, K", "Energy", "Starch", "Lactose"

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Finding the primary nutrients within key foods
 * Compare foods based on similarities in their nutrient quantities
 * Find food alternatives across nutrient categories
 * Take foods we know are healthy and discover what nutrients they contain

## Sketches

This one shows a potential way to represent connections between fruits. By showing connections as similarities and then having a key where you can select which attribute or nutrient is represented by the size of the data.

This visual shows other ways to potentially plot the data. To have two different attributes acros the X and Y axis and then Have friut images at the location of the fruits and these nutrients

These graphs work to show the foods and the similarities they have based onc ertain nutrients



## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatterplot and it shows connections and similarities between foods in certain nutrient groups. Here is a picture from the first prototype

This has two nutirents on the axises and points for each of the foods based on their quantitiy of that nutrient

I have used AI tools to add selectors for the axis and a third attribute controlling the size of the circles. As well as axis scale options and hover to see the name of the food. 


## Open Questions

I'm not sure if I selected the best nutirient groups to filter on. Lastly other visualization methods, like a force-directed layout for the nodes would be interesting but would convey less data.

## Milestones

From here I hope to create better visuals for the food icons
Clean up the data, to show more foods
And also create different ways to display the food similarities

I also could incorproate color to cover another attribute
