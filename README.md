# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The Data I propose to visualize is the food nutrient dataset from the FDC

- Here is a link to the data
  - https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets

- I had to purge many of the foods to fit the size
  requirements of vizhub, I might try and refactor the data, to only contain key nutrients to add all the food samples back in

- This contains a food and then a list of its nutrients, The
  name, and how much, in statistics, like median, max, min

## Attributes

- For each food there is a big list of nutrients and their quantities. The main ones Ill be looking at are
 "Carbohydrate, by difference", "Protein", "Total lipid (fat)", "Water", "Calcium, Ca", "Potassium, K", "Energy", "Starch", "Lactose"

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Finding the primary nutrients within key foods
 * Compare foods based on similarities in their nutrient quantities
 * Find food alternatives across nutrient categories
 * Take foods we know are healthy and discover what nutrients they contain

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
